          Given the incredible popularity of the Soloist, some guitarists sought an instrument that boasted Jackson’s trademark speed and high performance in a bolt-on-neck model similar to those made by the company’s older sibling, Charvel®.

       <p class="txtwhite cnt-margin">
          Born to be played onstage and armed with an electrifying shape and lightning-fast neck, the Kelly has been a popular Jackson staple ever since its 1984 introduction. This has to be the coolest axe ever from one of the genre’s greatest names.”

       <p class="txtwhite cnt-margin">
          With metal exploding with fret-burning flamboyance in the mid-1980s, many artists clamored for Jackson Rhoads-style personality and playability in a larger-bodied axe better suited to taller players (Randy Rhoads himself measured a diminutive 5’ 2”).

        <p class="txtwhite cnt-margin">
          The Rhoads is the guitar that started it all. The first instrument to ever bear the name “Jackson” on its headstock, it was born in 1980 from a design sketched on a napkin by the late, great Randy Rhoads and company founder Grover Jackson.

       <p class="txtwhite cnt-margin">
          Jackson introduced its most outlandish and brutal-looking body design, the aptly named Warrior, in late 1989. Created with a dark new breed of artist in mind, it was designed as a vicious-looking new sonic weapon with smartly savage style.

       <p class="txtwhite cnt-margin">
          The concept of creating a sleek and deadly guitar combining a traditional double-cutaway body style and scale length with shark-like high performance was ingrained into Jackson’s DNA at birth in the early 1980s.

          <h3>THE WORLD FAMOUS JACKSON CUSTOM SHOP</h3>
        </section>

        <section class="grid_8">
          <p>The world’s longest-operating custom shop, turning out world-class custom guitars ever since Grover Jackson first affixed his name to a headstock in 1980
          </p><br>
        </section>

        <section class="grid_8">
          <p>
            The reason for this amazing longevity is simple: Jackson began as a custom shop. In the beginning, there were no production guitars—every Jackson guitar was a highly original high-performance custom instrument.
          </p><br>
          <p>
            If you can dream it, we can build it. It’s a longstanding tradition of U.S.-made greatness and devotion to craft that continues to this day. The Jackson Custom Shop—the original custom shop.
